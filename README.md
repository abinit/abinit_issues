## About 

This is a github repository for issues and bugs related to [Abinit](http://www.abinit.org/). 
Users are invited to commit input files that can be used by developers to reproduce the issue,
confirm the bug and then work on the bug fix. 
Please note that the purpose of this repository is to facilitate the exchange of input files
between Abinit users and developers. 
This repo is *not* meant to replace our [support forum](http://forum.abinit.org/). 
that, actually, represents the official reference to be consulted if you've encountered 
a problem or you need some help.

## Submitting

### Before you start:

* Search the forum and the github issue tracker to ensure that your issue is not a duplicate

* If you think you've discovered a real bug, fork the repository and create a new issue on github
  (follow the instructions below)

### Create a new issue:

* Give a meaningful Title to your post that may help us to find/remember your post easily. 
  Your title should allow users browsing the tracker to grasp the gist of your issue at a glance.
  Avoid `HELP`, `PLEASE`, `Question`, `(BLANK)`, which are useless and provide no information
  (and do not improve your chances of getting an answer, on the contrary...)

* Fill the sections reported in the issue template. Be clear and concise in your description and 
  take advantage of [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/)

* Submit the issue, take note of the issue identifier generated by github. 

### Add the files needed to reproduce the issue:

* Fork the repository and get a local copy with:
  ```
  git clone git@github.com:YOURNAME/abinit_issues.git
  ```

* Create a new directory named `issue_id` where `id` is the identifier associated 
  to the the issue you've just created on github

* Provide whole/complete files neeeded to reproduce the error. More specifically:

    *  Abinit input files and files file
    *  Pseudopotential files
    *  The configuration options and the config.log file produced by configure (if available)
       or, alternatively, the output of `abinit -b` 

Please **do not** add binary files to the repository
