## Summary

This section should provide a detailed explanation of the issue.
Is the erratic behaviour sistematic? Does it show up only for particular
combinations of input variables, number of MPI processors?
Do you encounter similar behaviour if you change architecture/compilers/libraries?

## Error message  (if any)

Error message found in `__ABI_MPIABORT__` or in other log files
```

## Steps to reproduce

If applicable, this section should provide a detailed list of steps needed to reproduce the issue.
